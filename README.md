## Introduction

This project aims to develop a user-friendly web-based system that uses advanced deep learning (CNN) models to detect tuberculosis (TB) from chest X-ray images. The system enables real-time feedback, allowing users to instantly receive diagnostic results, improving early detection and timely treatment. By automating TB detection, the solution targets regions with limited healthcare resources, providing quick and reliable diagnoses to aid healthcare professionals.

## Objectives

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Design a web interface for easy uploading and analysis of chest X-ray images.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Implement a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect TB from chest X-rays.
- **Real-Time Diagnosis**: Display the TB diagnosis along with a confidence score.
- **Visualization**: Highlight TB-affected areas in X-ray images using Grad-CAM and SHAP/LIME for interpretable results.

## Features

- **Real-Time TB Detection**: Automatically detects TB from uploaded chest X-ray images.
- **Confidence Score**: Provides a confidence score indicating the likelihood of TB detection.
- **Interpretable Results**: Uses Grad-CAM and SHAP/LIME to highlight affected lung regions for better understanding.
- **Scalable and Accessible**: Designed for deployment in underserved regions to support early detection.
- **Web Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for healthcare professionals to upload X-ray images and receive instant feedback.

## Usage

- Upload a chest X-ray image through the web interface.
- Get a real-time diagnosis indicating whether TB is present, along with a confidence score.
- View the affected regions in the X-ray using Grad-CAM and SHAP/LIME visualization techniques.
- Use the system for both clinical and research purposes to detect TB early.
